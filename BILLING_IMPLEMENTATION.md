This document outlines the Google Play billing implementation for Aivellum app, supporting both individual prompt purchases and lifetime access.

## Overview

The app implements Google Play in-app purchases with two product types:
1. **Individual Prompt Unlock** (₹4.00) - Consumable product for unlocking single prompts
2. **Lifetime Access** (₹999.00) - Non-consumable product for unlocking all prompts forever

## Product Configuration

The following products are configured in Google Play Console:

#### 1. Unlock All Prompts
- **Product ID**: `unlock_all_prompts`
- **Type**: Non-consumable (managed product)
- **Price**: ₹999.00
- **Name**: Unlock All Prompts

### RSA Public Key
